The terms "parallel computing" and "distributed computing" have a lot of overlap, and no clear distinction exists between them.  
    
Parallel computing may be seen as a particular tightly coupled form of distributed computing, and  
distributed computing may be seen as a loosely coupled form of parallel computing.  
  
Nevertheless, it is possible to roughly classify concurrent systems as "parallel" or "distributed" using the following criteria:  
In parallel computing, all processors may have access to a shared memory to exchange information between processors.  
In distributed computing, each processor has its own private memory (distributed memory). Information is exchanged by passing messages between the processors.
